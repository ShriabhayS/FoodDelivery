# 🤖 Autonomous Robot Vision System

A comprehensive robotics platform combining SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), computer vision, and autonomous navigation capabilities. Built for real-time object detection and mapping using PenguinPi robots.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time SLAM**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with ArUco marker detection
- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8-powered object detection for target identification
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Path planning and obstacle avoidance
- **Multi-mode Operation**: Physical robot control, simulation, and demo modes
- **Live Visualization**: Real-time GUI showing robot pose, detected objects, and map data

## 🛠️ System Architecture

### Core Components

- **Robot Vision Module** (`robot_vision/`): Main SLAM and vision processing
- **SLAM Testing** (`slam_testing/`): Evaluation and testing framework
- **Basic Setup** (`basic_setup/`): Fundamental robot control utilities
- **Installation Scripts**: Automated environment setup

### Key Technologies

- **YOLOv8**: State-of-the-art object detection
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision processing
